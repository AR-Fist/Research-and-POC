# Research-and-POC

This repository contains 2 parts
1. Detectron2

   - Using Panoptic segmentation -> deploying on Android with caffe2 (Not practical)
   - This approach does not support for real-time application purpose
   
2. Traditional OpenCV approach
   - Using OpenCV in kotlin style ( Convert road-detection algorithm in python to kotlin style )
   - You can check this approach in https://github.com/AR-Fist/RoadDetection
